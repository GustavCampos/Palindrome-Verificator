# Palindrome-Verificator
In this small project, i've been putting in pratice my new knowledge in CSS and principly in JS.

This aplication basically read everithing you write in an input, then you get an answer if what you wrote is a palindrome or not.

Here i'm just focussed in play a little with dinamic classes and regular expressions in JS.
